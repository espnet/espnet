# In the lexicons provided by babel there are phonemes x_y, for which _y may
# or may not best be considered as a tag on phoneme x. In Lithuanian, for
# instance, there is a phoneme A_F for which _F or indicates failling tone.
# This same linguistic feature is represented in other languages as a "tag"
# (i.e. åˆ¤ pun3 p u: n _3), which means for the purposes of kaldi, that
# those phonemes share a root in the clustering decision tree, and the tag
# becomes an extra question. We may want to revisit this issue later.

# The local/prepare_dict.py script, which is basically the same as
# prepare_unicode_lexicon.py used in the babel recipe to create the
# graphemic lexicons, is better suited for working with kaldi formatted
# lexicons and can be used for this task by only modifying optional input
# arguments. If we could modify local/prepare_lexicon.pl to accomodate this
# need it may be more intuitive.
