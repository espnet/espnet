# This configuration reuqires 1 gpus in the case of each gpu memory = 12GB.
# To use this configuration, you need the model trained with `conf/tuning/train_transformer.v1`.
# First, you should train the above model or download from google drive and put it in exp dirctory.
# Make sure the `teacher-model` path is valid and the encoder structure is the same as teacher
# when `init-encoder-from-teacher = True`.
# This configuration uses Conv1d in Transformer blocks and aheads = 2 compared to v1.
