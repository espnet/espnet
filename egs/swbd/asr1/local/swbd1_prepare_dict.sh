# Map the words in the lexicon.  That is-- for each word in the lexicon, we map it
# to a new written form.  The transformations we do are:
# remove laughter markings, e.g.
# [LAUGHTER-STORY] -> STORY
# Remove partial-words, e.g.
# -[40]1K W AH N K EY
# becomes -1K
# and
# -[AN]Y IY
# becomes
# -Y
# -[A]B[OUT]- B
# becomes
# -B-
# Also, curly braces, which appear to be used for "nonstandard"
# words or non-words, are removed, e.g.
# {WOLMANIZED} W OW L M AX N AY Z D
# -> WOLMANIZED
# Also, mispronounced words, e.g.
#  [YEAM/YEAH] Y AE M
# are changed to just e.g. YEAM, i.e. the orthography
# of the mispronounced version.
# Note-- this is only really to be used in training.  The main practical
# reason is to avoid having tons of disambiguation symbols, which
# we otherwise would get because there are many partial words with
# the same phone sequences (most problematic: S).
# Also, map
# THEM_1 EH M -> THEM
# so that multiple pronunciations just have alternate entries
# in the lexicon.
