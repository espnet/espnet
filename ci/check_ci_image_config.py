"""Check that the prebuilt CI image configuration is self-consistent.

The tag of the prebuilt CI image is a hash of the files that determine its
contents. That list appears twice - once where the image is built, once where a
job resolves the tag to pull - and the two must agree exactly. If they drift,
the build publishes one tag and every job asks for another, so nothing can be
pulled.

That is not hypothetical: adding ci/install_kaldi.sh to one list and not the
other is what this check was written for.

Second, every python x pytorch combination a job asks for must be one that
ci/image_variants.json says is built. A job asking for a variant nobody builds
gets `manifest unknown`, and the fallback would quietly hide it behind a slow
build instead.

Third, the config-task list the integration matrix is built from must match the
tasks ci/test_integration_espnet2.sh actually implements. A task in the matrix
and not the script runs the script's default and silently tests the wrong thing;
a task in the script and not the matrix is never run at all.
