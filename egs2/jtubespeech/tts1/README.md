# JTUBESPEECH RECIPE

This is the recipe of a Japanese multi-speaker TTS model with [JTubeSpeech](https://github.com/sarulab-speech/jtubespeech).
The script automatically downloads and uses about 20GB subset of a single-speaker split.
You can change the CTC-score threshold for data pruning (default is -0.1) with `/local/data.sh`.
