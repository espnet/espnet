# Notes

## Kaldi required

Even though this example is in egs2 directory, which shouldn't require Kaldi installed as the [espnet installation guide](https://espnet.github.io/espnet/installation.html) states. Unfortunately, due to the limitation of a script related to data processing. A program called `wav-to-duration` from Kaldi toolkit is still required in this example.
Therefore, do make sure to follow the instruction to correctly set the path of Kaldi.
