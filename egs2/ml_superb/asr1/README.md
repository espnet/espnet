# Multilingual SUPERB (ML-SUPERB) benchmark

## Basic Information

### Language coverage (143 languages)
ML-SUPERB is designed to cover a wide range of languages, including both high-resource languages like English and endangered languages such as Totonac.

### Tasks
- Monolingual Track: monolingual speech recognition (ASR)
- Multilingual Track: multilingual ASR, language identification (LID), joint multilingual ASR+LID

### Dataset
Dataset are extracted from various multilingual sources. All sources are with either Creative Commons, MIT, GNU, or Free-BSD licenses, which are available for both industrial and academic research, permissively.

## Major usage guidelines

### Data download/setup

[Download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zslKQwadZaYWXAmfBCvlos9BVQ9k6PHT/view?usp=sharing)

After download the dataset, please set the `MLSUPERB` to the data directory. The preparation will be automatically done in scripts for each tasks.

### Self-supervised model setup

ML-SUPERB utilizes [S3PRL](https://github.com/s3prl/s3prl) to support different self-supervised model, supporting both the current popular self-supervised models and customized models from users.

#### Existng self-supervised model

To use existing self-supervised model (e.g., models suppported by S3PRL), you can set the following configs for model training:

- For model directly supported by S3PRL, you may set the following argument in the yaml-style config files located in `conf/tuning`:
```
frontend: s3prl
frontend_conf:
    frontend_conf:
        upstream: hubert_large_ll60k
    download_dir: ./hub
    multilayer_feature: True
```
- For model from huggingface (still supported by S3PRL, such as HuBERT trained on specific languages), the config can be as:
```
frontend: s3prl
frontend_conf:
    frontend_conf:
        upstream: hf_hubert_custom
        path_or_url: <huggingface_id> # the huggingface ID (such as TencentGameMate/chinese-hubert-large)
    download_dir: ./hub
    multilayer_feature: True
```

**Note: If the upstream is changed, please change the input_size in the preencoder.**

#### Customized self-supervised model

To test the SSL model in ML-SUPERB that are not directly support in S3PRL, please first follow the guidelines at https://s3prl.github.io/s3prl/contribute/upstream.html to add new upstream models.

### Monolingual ASR

General steps to run tasks in monolingual ASR track are as follows:
- Step1: Following [downloading guide](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/ml_superb/asr1/README.md#data-downloadsetup) to prepare the data
- Step2: Adding the training configurations for the desired model at `conf/tuning` (check examples `conf/tuning/train_asr_s3prl_single.yaml` and `conf/tuning/train_asr_fbank_single.yaml`) **Note: only the frontend/learning rate can be changed for the benchmark.**
- Step3: Training the model by calling
```
./run_mono.sh --asr_config <your_training_config>
```
- Step4: Results are at `exp/mono_<your_training_config>.log`

### Multilingual ASR

General steps to run tasks in multilingual ASR task are as follows:
- Step1: Following [downloading guide](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/ml_superb/asr1/README.md#data-downloadsetup) to prepare the data
- Step2: Adding the training configurations for the desired model at `conf/tuning` (check examples `conf/tuning/train_asr_s3prl_{10min, 1h}.yaml` and `conf/tuning/train_asr_fbank_{10min, 1h}.yaml`) **Note: only the frontend/learning rate can be changed for the benchmark.**
- Step3: Training the 10min/1h model by calling
```
./run_multi.sh --asr_config <your_training_config> --duration {10min, 1h} --lid false --only_lid false
```


### LID

General steps to run tasks in LID trask are as follows:
- Step1: Following [downloading guide](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/ml_superb/asr1/README.md#data-downloadsetup) to prepare the data
- Step2: Adding the training configurations for the desired model at `conf/tuning` (check examples `conf/tuning/train_asr_s3prl_{10min, 1h}.yaml` and `conf/tuning/train_asr_fbank_{10min, 1h}.yaml`) **Note: only the frontend/learning rate can be changed for the benchmark.**
- Step3: Training the 10min/1h model by calling
```
./run_multi.sh --asr_config <your_training_config> --duration {10min, 1h} --lid false --only_lid true
```


### Multilingual ASR+LID

General steps to run tasks in LID trask are as follows:
- Step1: Following [downloading guide](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/ml_superb/asr1/README.md#data-downloadsetup) to prepare the data
- Step2: Adding the training configurations for the desired model at `conf/tuning` (check examples `conf/tuning/train_asr_s3prl_{10min, 1h}.yaml` and `conf/tuning/train_asr_fbank_{10min, 1h}.yaml`) **Note: only the frontend/learning rate can be changed for the benchmark.**
- Step3: Training the 10min/1h model by calling
```
./run_multi.sh --asr_config <your_training_config> --duration {10min, 1h} --lid true --only_lid false
```
