# üêÅPOWSM

POWSM is the first phonetic foundation model that can perform four phone-related tasks:
Phone Recognition (PR), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), audio-guided grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and audio-guided phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G).

Based on [Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM)](https://www.wavlab.org/activities/2024/owsm/) and trained with [IPAPack++](https://huggingface.co/anyspeech), POWSM outperforms or matches specialized PR models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P, P2G, and ASR.

The model checkpoint is available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/espnet/powsm)!

## Guidelines
1. Download IPAPack++: `local/data.sh --stage 0 --stop_stage 0`
    - Raw data will be located at `downloads/`
    - `transcripts.csv` contains orthography, phones, and path to audio file
2. Data prep: stage 1-4, can be done without GPU. The extracted `dump/raw` is around 1T.
    - `local/data_prep.py` normalizes phones into [PanPhon](https://github.com/dmort27/panphon) phone entries through greedy trie search
    - A new transcript `transcripts_normalized.csv` is then generated
    - Wav files are dumped to ark files in `data/format.{i}/`
    - `local/process_ipapack.py` generates OWSM format text files for each task, which looks like: `uttid_task <lang><task><notimestamp> text`
    - `local/subset.py` combines text files and generate other files accordingly. It also has other functions to get subsets in different ways
3. Train BPE: stage 5
    - `data/nlsyms.txt` and `data/bpe_nlsyms.txt` define symbols that should be regarded as a token, such as task tokens and phones
    - Since `train.txt` is large, this step requires quite a lot of GPU memory
4. (stage 6-9 are skipped automatically)
5. Collect stats and train: stage 10-11
6. Eval: stage 12-13, compute intensive, decode each dataset seperately to set language and task token.
