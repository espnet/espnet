# Speech Tokenizer

This directory is the ESPnet2 recipe template for training a differentiable
speech tokenizer with ASR and speaker-conditioned reconstruction objectives.

## Recipe flow

1. Prepare Kaldi-style data directories.
2. Apply optional speed perturbation.
3. Format and resample waveforms.
4. Filter training and validation utterances by duration.
5. Prepare the ASR token list.
6. Extract one speaker embedding per utterance.
7. Train offline K-means centroids, or validate an external centroid model.
8. Collect shapes for speech, text, and speaker embeddings.
9. Train the speech tokenizer and its downstream objectives.
10. Extract discrete token sequences without loading downstream objectives.

The GAN task uses two optimizers and `SpeechTokenizerGANTrainer`.
Speaker embeddings are required for reconstruction during training.

## Creating a corpus recipe

From the ESPnet repository root, run:

```bash
egs2/TEMPLATE/tok1/setup.sh egs2/<corpus>/tok1
```

Then provide `local/data.sh`, a training configuration under `conf/`, and a
small `run.sh` that calls `tok.sh` with corpus-specific dataset
names. Common scripts and utilities are shared with the ASR template.

## K-means initialization

By default, stage 7 extracts `wavlm_large/21` features from ten percent of the
training data and learns 2000 centroids. To use an existing ESPnet ASR2 K-means
model instead, specify:

```bash
./tok.sh --centroid_path /path/to/km_2000.mdl ...
```

## Training

Run joint ASR and GAN reconstruction training:

```bash
./tok.sh \
    --tok_task gan_tok \
    --tok_config conf/train_gan.yaml \
    ...
```

Tokenizer-only inference writes `token` and `token_length` files. It does not
construct the ASR or reconstruction models and does not require speaker
embeddings at inference time.
