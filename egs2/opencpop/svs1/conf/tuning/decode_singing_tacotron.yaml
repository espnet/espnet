# This configuration is the basic decoding setting for Singing Tacotron.
# It can be also applied to Transformer. If you met some problems
# such as deletions or repetitions, it is worthwhile to try
# `use_att_constraint: true` or `use_dynamic_filter: true`(for GDCA)
# to make the generation more stable.
# Note that attention constraint is not supported in Transformer.
