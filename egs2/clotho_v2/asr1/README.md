# Clotho Audio Captioning RECIPE

This recipe implements the DCASE 2023 Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) task with a BEATs encoder BART decoder model on the Clotho_v2 dataset, very close to what is described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17352) and reusing part of code from the [original implementation](https://github.com/slSeanWU/beats-conformer-bart-audio-captioner?tab=readme-ov-file).
More specifically, we provide the pre-training and fine-tuning code for second last row in Table 2 (without Instructor embedding) from the paper. 
We also reuse the code from the [BEATs repository](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beats) for this implementation.

# Training Details and Requirements
The training is divided into an AAC pre-training and a fine-tuning stage.
We do the AAC pre-training on [AudioCaps](https://aclanthology.org/N19-1011/) and [Clotho ChatGPT mixup](https://huggingface.co/datasets/slseanwu/clotho-chatgpt-mixup-50K) data.
Fine-tuning is performed only on the standard development set of Clotho_v2 dataset.


### Steps to run

1. Download AudioCaps and set the path to its root directory in db.sh (This recipe downloads clotho for you). Also download clotho mixup data (wav ids and captions) from [this repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/slseanwu/clotho-chatgpt-mixup-50K) and set `CLOTHO_CHATGPT_MIXUP` in db.sh. The code will take care of mixing and creating the audio files.
2. Download the BEATs checkpoint: [BEATs_iter3+](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21AGXnEG4l3mlIzfA&id=6B83B49411CA81A7%2125960&cid=6B83B49411CA81A7&parId=root&parQt=sharedby&o=OneUp) and change the `beats_ckpt_path` path in `conf/beats_bart_pt.yaml`
3. Launch with `run.sh`


## Trained checkpoints
AAC Pre-trained model: https://huggingface.co/espnet/DCASE23.AudioCaptioning.PreTrained

Fine-tuned model: https://huggingface.co/espnet/DCASE23.AudioCaptioning.FineTuned


### GPU Time
AAC pre-training takes around ~4 hours on two A6000 gpus.
Fine-tuning, decoding and evalution takes ~1 hour on two A6000.
All the scripts above are setup with 2 GPUs but that can be changed with the `ngpu` argument. Please make sure to change the batch size accordingly (the provided setup requires 42.6GB GPU memory).
