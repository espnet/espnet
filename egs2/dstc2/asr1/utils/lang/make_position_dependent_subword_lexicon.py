    There are 4 types of position-dependent subword:
    1) Beginning subword. It can only appear at the beginning of a word.
       The first phone suffix should be "_B" and other suffixes should be "_I"s:
        nation@@ 1.0 n_B ey_I sh_I ih_I n_I
        n@@      1.0 n_B
    2) Middle subword. It can only appear at the middle of a word.
       All phone suffixes should be "_I"s:
        nation@@ 1.0 n_I ey_I sh_I ih_I n_I
    3) End subword. It can only appear at the end of a word.
       The last phone suffix should be "_E" and other suffixes should be "_I"s:
        nation   1.0 n_I ey_I sh_I ih_I n_E
        n        1.0 n_E
    4) Singleton subword (i.e., the subword is word it self).
       The first phone suffix should be "_B" and the last suffix should be "_E".
       All other suffixes should be "_I"s. If there is only one phone, its suffix should be "_S":
        nation   1.0 n_B ey_I sh_I ih_I n_E
        n        1.0 n_S
