class EnvironmentProvider:
    """A base interface to build and inject per-process environments.

    This class separates responsibilities for constructing shared
    resources (e.g., dataset/model/tokenizer) that need to be created
    either once on the driver or once per worker process.

    Subclasses should implement ``build_env_local`` and
    ``make_worker_setup_fn`` to define how the environment is built
    in local (driver) execution and distributed (worker) execution.

    Args:
        config (DictConfig): A Hydra/OmegaConf configuration object
            that contains all parameters needed to build the environment.

    Notes:
        - The environment returned by these builders must be a plain
          dictionary of lightweight, pickleable objects or handles
          that are safe to share within a worker process.
        - For distributed runs, heavy initialization should be done inside
          the worker setup function so each worker constructs its own copy.
