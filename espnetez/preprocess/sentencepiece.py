    Create a training text file for SentencePiece model training from the
    provided dump text files.

    This function consolidates multiple text files into a single `train.txt`
    file, which is formatted for use in SentencePiece training. It also
    provides an option to remove specified characters from the text before
    writing to the output file.

    Args:
        dump_text_paths (Union[str, Path]):
            A single dump text file path or a list of paths to the dump
            text files that will be processed.
        output_path (Union[str, Path]):
            The directory where the `train.txt` file will be saved.
            If the directory does not exist, it will be created.
        remove_characters (str, optional):
            A string containing characters to be removed from the text.
            Defaults to an empty string, meaning no characters will be
            removed.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If any of the dump text files do not exist.
        IOError: If there is an error reading from the dump text files
        or writing to the output path.

    Examples:
        >>> prepare_sentences("data/dump.txt", "output", remove_characters=",.!")
        This will create an `output/train.txt` file from `data/dump.txt`,
        removing commas, periods, and exclamation marks from the text.

        >>> prepare_sentences(["data/dump1.txt", "data/dump2.txt"], "output")
        This will create an `output/train.txt` file by concatenating
        `data/dump1.txt` and `data/dump2.txt` without removing any characters.

    Note:
        Ensure that the input dump text files are properly formatted, as
        the function expects each line to have a space-separated format
        where the text to be processed is after the first space.

    Main function to train a SentencePiece model.

    This function trains a SentencePiece model using the provided training
    data and saves the resulting model and vocabulary files to the specified
    output directory. The model can be customized through various parameters
    such as vocabulary size, character coverage, and model type.

    Args:
        dump_text_path (Union[str, Path]): Path to the `train.txt` file
            containing the training data for the SentencePiece model.
        output_path (Union[str, Path]): Output directory where the trained
            SentencePiece model and vocabulary list will be stored.
        vocab_size (int, optional): The size of the vocabulary to be generated
            by the SentencePiece model. Defaults to 5000.
        character_coverage (float, optional): The character coverage rate
            for the model, which indicates the percentage of characters in
            the training data that should be covered. Defaults to 0.9995.
        model_type (str, optional): The type of model to be trained.
            Options include 'bpe' (Byte Pair Encoding), 'unigram',
            'char', and 'word'. Defaults to "bpe".
        user_defined_symbols (list, optional): A list of user-defined symbols
            that should be included in the model. Defaults to an empty list.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the specified `dump_text_path` does not exist.
        Exception: If the training of the SentencePiece model fails for any
            reason.

        Ensure that the `train.txt` file has been prepared using the
