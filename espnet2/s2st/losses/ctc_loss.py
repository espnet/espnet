class S2STCTCLoss(AbsS2STLoss):
    """
        CTC-based loss for S2ST.

    This class implements a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss
    for sequence-to-sequence translation tasks. It inherits from the
    abstract class `AbsS2STLoss`. The primary purpose of this loss is to
    calculate the weighted loss for training models in sequence-to-sequence
    tasks.

    Attributes:
        weight (float): A scalar weight to scale the final loss. Default is 1.0.

    Args:
        weight (float): The weight for the loss calculation. Default is 1.0.

    Returns:
        float: The computed loss value scaled by the weight.

    Examples:
        >>> loss_function = S2STCTCLoss(weight=0.5)
        >>> loss_value = loss_function.forward(loss=2.0)
        >>> print(loss_value)  # Output: 2.0

    Note:
        This implementation currently provides a dummy CTC loss that
        only returns the input loss value scaled by the weight.

    Todo:
        - Implement a real CTC loss computation in the forward method.
