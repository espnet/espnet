class ESPnetSpeakerModel(AbsESPnetModel):
    """
    Speaker embedding extraction model.
    Core model for diverse speaker-related tasks (e.g., verification, open-set
    identification, diarization)

    The model architecture comprises mainly 'encoder', 'pooling', and
    'projector'.
    In common speaker recognition field, the combination of three would be
    usually named as 'speaker_encoder' (or speaker embedding extractor).
    We splitted it into three for flexibility in future extensions:
      - 'encoder'   : extract frame-level speaker embeddings.
      - 'pooling'   : aggregate into single utterance-level embedding.
      - 'projector' : (optional) additional processing (e.g., one fully-
                      connected layer) to derive speaker embedding.

    Possibly, in the future, 'pooling' and/or 'projector' can be integrated as
    a 'decoder', depending on the extension for joint usage of different tasks
    (e.g., ASR, SE, target speaker extraction).
