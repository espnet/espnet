# Converting audio file formats using format_wav_scp.py

The [format_wav_scp.py](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/master/egs2/TEMPLATE/asr1/pyscripts/audio/format_wav_scp.py) is an utility to convert the audio format of the files specified `wav.scp`
and the [format_wav_scp.sh](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/TEMPLATE/asr1/scripts/audio/format_wav_scp.sh) is a shell script wrapping `format_wav_scp.py`.
In the typical case, in the stage3 of [the template recipe](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/TEMPLATE),
`format_wav_scp.sh` is used to convert the audio file format of your original corpus to the audio format which you actually want to feed to the DNN model.

Note that `format_wav_scp.py` dumps files with linear PCM with `sint16le` regardless the input audio format.

## Quick usage

```sh
# Please change directory before using our shell scripts
cd egs2/some_corpus/some_task

cmd=utils/run.pl
nj=10  # Number of parallel jobs
audio_fomrat=flac  # The audio codec of output files
fs=16k  # The sampling frequency of output files
ref_channels=0  # If the input data has multiple channels and you want to use only a single channel in the file (please spicify the channel with 0-based number)
./scripts/audio/format_wav_scp.sh --nj "${nj}" --cmd "${cmd}" --audio_format "${audio_format}" --fs "${fs}" --ref_channels "${ref_channels}" somewhere/wav.scp output_dir

# Then, you can find output_dir/wav.scp
```

## Why is audio file formatting necessary?

The audio data included in the corpus obtained from the source website are distributed in various audio file formats,
i.e., the audio codec (`wav` with `linear PCM`, `u-law`, `a-law`, `flac`, `mp3`, or etc.), the sampling frequency (`48khz`, `44.1khz`, `16khz`, `8khz`, or etc.),
the data precision and the type (`uint8`, `sint16`, `sint32`, `float20`, `float32` or etc.),
the number of channels (`monaural`, `stereo`, or more than 2ch), little endian / big endian.

When you try to develop a new recipe with a corpus that is not yet prepared in our recipes,
of course, you can also try to use the audio data as they are without any formatting.
However,
in a typical case, the configuration of our DNN model may assume the specific audio format,
especially regarding the sampling frequency and the data precision.
If youã€€are conservative with your new recipe,
we recommend converting them to the original recipe's audio format.
For example, `16khz` and `sint16` audio is typically used in our ASR recipes.


## The audio file formats supported in ESPnet2

ESPnet adopts [python soundifile](https://github.com/bastibe/python-soundfile)
for data loading, and, thus the supported audio codec depend on [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/).

You can check the supported audio codecs of `soundfile` with the following command:

```python
import soundfile
print(soundfile.available_formats())
```

Depending on the situation, you may choose one of the following codecs:

|  Codec  |  Compression | Maximum number of channnels |Note|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  wav (Microsoft wav with linear pcm) | No |  1024  | |
|  flac  |  Lossless  | 8 | |
| mp3 | Lossy | 2 | The patent of MP3 has expired |
| ogg (Vorbis) | Lossy | ? | Segmentation fault sometimes happens |


By default, we select `flac` because `flac` can convert linear pcm files with compression rate of ~55 % without data loss.
If you would like to change it to the other format, please use `--audio_format` option for `run.sh`.

```sh
cd egs2/some_corpus/some_task
./run.sh --audio_format mp3
```

Note that if the audio files in your corpus are disributed with lossy audio codec, such as `MP3`,
it's better to keep the file format to avoid the duplication with massive audio format.

## Use case


### Case1: Extract segmentations with long recoding

Create `wav.scp` and `segments` with the format of `The format is <utterance_id> <wav_id> <start_time> <end_time>`.
Note that the time is in second unit.

`wav.scp`:

```
record_a a.wav
...
```

`segments`:

```
segment_a record_a 0.98 11.56
segment_a record_a 12.34 15.43
...
```



Then, you can extract the segments with:


```sh
./scripts/audio/format_wav_scp.sh --segments segments wav.scp output_dir
```

### Case2: Extract audio data from video codec / Use non supported format by soundfile

`ffmpeg` is required. Create `wav.scp` as following:

```
ID_a ffmpeg -i "ID_a.mp4" -f wav -af pan="1c|c0=c0" -acodec pcm_s16le - |
ID_b ffmpeg -i "ID_b.mp4" -f wav -af pan="1c|c0=c0" -acodec pcm_s16le - |
...
```

- Note: `-af pan` is [pan filter](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#pan-1).
  - `<num>c` specifies `<num>` of output channels
  - `c<out-channel>=c<in-channel>` assigns `<in-channel>`th channel
- Caution: `-map_channel` option is deprecated and will be removed.
