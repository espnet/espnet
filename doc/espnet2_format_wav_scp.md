# Converting audio file formats using format_wav_scp.py

The [format_wav_scp.py](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/master/egs2/TEMPLATE/asr1/pyscripts/audio/format_wav_scp.py) is an utility to convert the audio format of the files specified `wav.scp` 
and the [format_wav_scp.sh](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/TEMPLATE/asr1/scripts/audio/format_wav_scp.sh) is a shell script wrapping `format_wav_scp.py`. 
In the typical case, in the stage3 of [the template recipe](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/blob/master/egs2/TEMPLATE), 
`format_wav_scp.sh` is used to convert the audio file format of your original corpus to the audio format which you actually want to feed to the DNN model. 

## Quick usage

```sh
# Please change directory before using our shell scripts
cd egs2/some_corpus/some_task

cmd=utils/run.pl
nj=10  # Number of parallel jobs
audio_fomrat=flac  # The audio codec of output files
fs=16k  # The sampling frequency of output files
ref_channels=0  # If the input data has multiple channels and you want to use only a single channel in the file (please spicify the channel with 0-based number)
./scripts/audio/format_wav_scp.sh --nj "${nj}" --cmd "${cmd}" --audio_format "${audio_format}" --fs "${fs}" --ref_channels "${ref_channels}" somewhere/wav.scp output_dir

# The, you can find output_dir/wav.scp
```

## Why is audio file formatting necessary?

The audio data included in the corpus obtained from the source website are distributed in various audio file formats, 
i.e., the audio codec (`wav`, `flac`, `mp3`, or etc.), the sampling frequency (`48khz`, `44.1khz`, `16khz`, `8khz`, or etc.), 
the data precision and the type (`uint8`, `int16`, `int32`, `float20`, `float32`, or etc.), 
the number of channels (`monaural`, `stereo`, or more than 2ch). 

When you try to develop a new recipe with a corpus that is not yet prepared in our recipes, 
of course, you can also try to use the audio data as they are without any formatting. 
However, 
in a typical case, the configuration of our DNN model may assume the specific audio format,
especially regarding the sampling frequency and the data precision. 
If youã€€are conservative with your new recipe,
we recommend converting them to the original recipe's audio format. 
For example, 16khz and int16 audio files are typically used in our ASR recipes.


## The audio file formats supported in ESPnet2

ESPnets adopts [python soundifile](https://github.com/bastibe/python-soundfile) 
for data loading, and, thus the supported audio codec depend on [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/).

You can check the supported audio codecs of `soundfile` with the following command:

```python
import soundfile
print(soundfile.available_formats())
```

Depending on the situation, you may choose one of the following three formats:

|  codec  |  compression | Some notes|
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  wav (microsoft wav with linear pcm)  |  No  | |
|  flac  |  Lossless  | Maximum channel number is 8ch |
| mp3 | Lossy | The patent of MP3 has expired |


By default, we select `flac` because `flac` can convert linear pcm files with ~55 % compression rate the audio without data loss.
If you would like to change it to the other format, please use `--audio_format` option for `run.sh`. 

```sh
cd egs2/some_corpus/some_task
./run.sh --audio_format mp3
```
