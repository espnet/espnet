This directory contains DNN scripts based on the nnet2 recipes found in
the ASR examples (e.g., fisher_english). The scripts have been modified
for speaker recognition purposes. Most of the scripts are lightly modified
versions of those appearing in the steps or local directories of
egs/fisher_english.
