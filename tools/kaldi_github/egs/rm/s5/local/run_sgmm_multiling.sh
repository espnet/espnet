# The only important thing is that the WSJ data has the same sample rate as the

# This script converts the models in the directory to use the new integer values
# for the phones, as in data/lang_rm_wsj.
# Everything else will be copied.  The only thing changed in the models is
# the transition-ids.  We'll need a program call like
#  gmm-convert <phone-map-file> <model-in> <model-out>
# where each line of phone-map-file has two lines, (phone-in phone-out).
# This will just affect the transition model, by mapping all the phone-ids.
# We'll also need a program
#  convert-tree <phone-map-file> <tree-in> <tree-out>

# "merge-tree" program will need, for each tree, a record of which sets of
# phones it was supposed to handle, since this is not recorded in the tree
# itself-- we can get this from the transition models which do record this.
# probably the "merge-tree" program will have usage: 
# merge-tree <tree1> <phone-set-1> <tree2> <phone-set-2> ... <tree-out>
# where the phone-set-n's will probably be filenames that contain lists of
