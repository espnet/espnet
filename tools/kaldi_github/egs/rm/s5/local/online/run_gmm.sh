# Below is the basic online decoding.  There is no endpointing being done: the utterances
# are supplied as .wav files.  And the speaker information is known, so we can use adaptation
# info from previous utterances of the same speaker.  It's like an application where
# we have push-to-talk and push-to-finish, and it has been told who the speaker is.
# The reason it's "online" is that internally, it processes the .wav file sequentially
# as if you were capturing it from an audio stream, so that when you get to the end of the file
# it is ready with the decoded output, with very little latency.

# Below is online decoding with endpointing-- but the endpointing is just at the end of the
# utterance, not the beginning.  It's like a dialog system over the phone, where when it's your
# turn to speak it waits till you've finished saying something and then does something.  The
# endpoint detection is configurable in various ways (not demonstrated here), but it's not separate
# from the speech recognition, it uses the traceback of the decoder itself to endpoint (whether
# it's silence, and so on).
