This is a kaldi recipe for the 5th CHiME Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge (CHiME-5).

The ChiME-5 challenge will consider the problem of distant multi-microphone 
conversational speech recognition in everyday home environments. Speech material
was elicited using a dinner party scenario with efforts taken to capture data 
that is representative of natural conversational speech.
