# This is the "final" version of the script that runs trains the bottleneck system.
# It is to be run after run.sh (the new version, that uses the same number of phases
# for both the limitedLP and fullLP systems), and before run-BNF-system.sh.  This
# script is a bit "special" as it requires a GPU, and also the "ptdnn" tools by
# Yajie Miao to train the DNN.  Eventually the DNN training will be made a part
# of Kaldi, but this recipe uses these external tools.

# you will probably want to make exp_BNF/bnf_dnn_run a link to somewhere local
# while you are running this script.  It doesn't have to be accessible globally,
# the script copies the things you will need.
