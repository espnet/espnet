About the sprakbanken corpus:
    This corpus is a free corpus originally collected by NST for ASR purposes and currently 
    hosted by the Norwegian libraries. The corpus is multilingual and contains Swedish, 
    Norwegian (Bokm√•l) and Danish. The current setup uses the Danish subcorpus. The vocabulary is 
    large and there is approx. 350 hours of read-aloud speech with associated text scripts.

    Some months ago the corpus was republished here: http://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/#ticketsfrom?lang=en

    s5: This is the current recommended recipe. (Danish)
