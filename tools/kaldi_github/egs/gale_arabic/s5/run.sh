#NB: You can add whatever number of copora you like. The supported extensions 
#NB: (formats) are wav and flac. Flac will be converted using sox and in contrast
#NB: with the old approach, the conversion will be on-the-fly and one-time-only
#NB: during the parametrization.

#NB: Text corpora scpecification. We support either tgz files, which are unpacked
#NB: or just plain (already unpacked) directories. The list of transcript is then
#NB: obtained using find command

#This is CLSP configuration. We add the 2014 GALE data. We got around 2 % 
#improvement just by including it. The gain might be large if someone would tweak
# the number of leaves and states and so on.

#Make sure you edit this section to reflect whers you keep the LDC data on your cluster
