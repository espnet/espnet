These are the instructions to reproduce the TEDLIUM models described in
"Purely sequence-trained neural networks for ASR based on lattice-free
MMI", by Povey et al.

First run:

./run.sh

until the end of stage 7. (local/nnet/run_dnn.sh can be skipped.)

Then run:

local/chain/run_tdnn.sh

to see results for a generic chain model. See the script's header
comments to see other options, and their results.
