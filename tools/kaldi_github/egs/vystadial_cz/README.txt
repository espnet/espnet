Summary
-------
The data comprise over 15 hours of speech in Czech.

The Czech recordings were collected in three ways:

1. using a free Call Friend phone service
2. using the Repeat After Me speech data collecting process
3. from telephone interactions with the PublicTransportInfo Spoken Dialog System (SDS)
   Alex: http://ufal.ms.mff.cuni.cz/alex-dialogue-systems-framework/.

The data collection process is described in detail
in article "Free English and Czech telephone speech corpus shared under the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license"
published for LREC 2014 (To Appear).

WE USE COMMON KALDI DECODERS IN THE SCRIPTS (gmm-latgen-faster through steps/decode.sh)
However, the main purpose of providing the data and scripts
is training acoustic models for real-time speech recognition unit
for dialog system ALEX, which uses modified real-time Kaldi OnlineLatgenRecogniser.
The modified Kaldi decoders are NOT required for running the scripts!

The modified OnlineLatgenRecogniser is actively developed at 
https://github.com/UFAL-DSG/pykaldi/tree/master/src/onl-rec
and has Python wrapper:
https://github.com/UFAL-DSG/pykaldi/tree/master/src/pykaldi
Note that I am currently moving the online recogniser to:
http://sourceforge.net/p/kaldi/code/HEAD/tree/sandbox/oplatek2/

Expected results
----------------
The expected results were obtained simply by running
bash train_voip_cs.sh OR bash train_voip_en.sh.
Note that you need SRILM installed in path or at kaldi/tools/ directory!
See s5/RESULTS. Following notation is used:

    build2 - bigram LM from train data, estimated by the scripts using SRILM
    build0 - zerogram LM from test data, estimated by scripts using Python code
    LMW - Language model weight, we picked the best from (min_lmw, max_lmw) based on decoding results on DEV set


Details
-------
* Requires Kaldi installation and Linux environment. (Tested on Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04 and 12.10.)
* The config files s5/env_voip_cs.sh sets the data directory,
  mfcc directory and experiments directory.
* Our scripts prepare the data to the expected format in s5/data.
* Experiment files are stored to $exp directory e.g. s5/exp.
* The local directory contains scripts for data preparation to prepare 
  lang directory.
* path.sh, cmd.sh and  common/* contain configurations for the 
  recipe.
* Language model (LM) is either built from the training data using 
  [SRILM](http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/)  or we supply one in 
  the ARPA format.


Running experiments
-------------------
Before running the experiments, check that:

* you have the Kaldi toolkit compiled: 
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/kaldi/.
* you have SRILM compiled. (This is needed for building a language model 
  unless you supply your own LM in the ARPA format.) 
  See http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/.
* The number of jobs njobs are set correctly in path.sh.
* In cmd.sh, you switched to run the training on a SGE[*] grid if 
  required (disabled by default).

Start the recipe from the s5 directory by running 
bash run.sh.
It will create s5/mfcc, s5/data and s5/exp directories.
If any of them exists, it will ask you if you want them to be overwritten.

.. [*] Sun Grid Engine

Extracting the results and trained models
-----------------------------------------
The main scripts, s5/run.sh, 
perform not only training of the acoustic models, but also decoding.
The acoustic models are evaluated after running the training and  
reports are printed to the standard output.

The s5/local/results.py exp command extracts the results from the $exp directory.
and stores the results to exp/results.log.

If you want to use the trained acoustic model with your language model
outside the prepared script, you need to build the HCLG decoding graph yourself.  
See http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/graph.html for general introduction to the FST 
framework in Kaldi.

The simplest way to start decoding is to use the same LM which
was used by the s5/run.sh script.
Let's say you want to decode with 
the acoustic model stored in exp/tri2b_bmmi,
then you need files listed below:

================================= =====================================================================================
mfcc.conf                          Speech parametrisation (MFCC) settings. Training and decoding setup must match.
exp/tri2b_bmmi/graph/HCLG.fst      Decoding Graph. Graph part of AM plus lexicon, phone->3phone & LM representation.
exp/tri2b_bmmi/graph/words.txt     Word symbol table, a mapping between words and integers which are decoded.
exp/tri2b_bmmi/graph/silence.csl   List of phone integer ids, which represent silent phones. 
exp/tri2b_bmmi/final.mdl           Trained acoustic model (AM).
exp/tri2b_bmmi/final.mat           Trained matrix of feature/space transformations (E.g. LDA and bMMI).
================================= =====================================================================================


We recommend to study steps/decode.sh Kaldi standard script
for standalone decoding with gmm-latgen-faster Kaldi decoder.

In order to build your own decoding graph HCLG 
you need LM in ARPA format and files in table below. 

* Note 1: Building HCLG decoding graph is out of scope this README.
* Note 2: Each acoustic model needs corresponding HCLG graph.
* Note 3: The phonetic dictionary applied on the vocabulary 
  should always generate only a subset of phones seen in training data!

===============================  =========================================================================
