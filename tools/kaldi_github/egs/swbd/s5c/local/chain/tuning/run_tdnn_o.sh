# _o is as _n, but reducing the number of parameters to try to reduce
# over-training: reducing relu-dim from 1024 to 850 and target num-states
# from 12k to 9k.  Also modifying the splicing setup in a way that shouldn't
# affect num-params, from "-2,-1,0,1,2 -1,2 -3,3 -9,0,9 0" to
# "-2,-1,0,1,2 -1,2 -3,3 -6,3 -6,3".
#
# There seems to be a slight improvement: on train_dev, WER changes 19.04->18.99 before
# rescoring, and 17.45->17.29 after.   On all of eval2000 the WER changes
# from 20.8->20.6 before fg rescoring, and 18.7->18.5 after.

# _n is as _m but changing the egs configuration to get better and more even
# coverage of the data: increasing frames_per_eg from 150 to 200,
# and increasing --frames-overlap-per-eg from 10 to 30.
# I am also testing out some script changes in the get_egs.sh script that
# aims to reduce the number of small files (and some accompanying code changes
# that allow us to put the CPU-intensive phase of egs preparation with the
# 'shuffle' jobs).

# _m is as _k but after a code change that makes the denominator FST more
# compact.  I am rerunning in order to verify that the WER is not changed (since
# it's possible in principle that due to edge effects related to weight-pushing,
# the results could be a bit different).

# _k is as _i but reverting the g->h change, removing the --scale-max-param-change
# option and setting max-param-change to 1..  Using the same egs.

# _i is as _h but longer egs: 150 frames instead of 75, and
# 128 elements per minibatch instead of 256.

# _h is as _g but different application of max-param-change (use --scale-max-param-change true)

# _g is as _f but more splicing at last layer.

# _f is as _e but with 30 as the number of left phone classes instead
# of 10.

# _e is as _d but making it more similar in configuration to _b.
# (turns out b was better than a after all-- the egs' likelihoods had to
# be corrected before comparing them).
# the changes (vs. d) are: change num-pdfs target from 8k to 12k,
# multiply learning rates by 5, and set final-layer-normalize-target to 0.5.

# _d is as _c but with a modified topology (with 4 distinct states per phone
# instead of 2), and a slightly larger num-states (8000) to compensate for the
# different topology, which has more states.

# _c is as _a but getting rid of the final-layer-normalize-target (making it 1.0
# as the default) as it's not clear that it was helpful; using the old learning-rates;
# and modifying the target-num-states to 7000.

# _b is as as _a except for configuration changes: using 12k num-leaves instead of
# 5k; using 5 times larger learning rate, and --final-layer-normalize-target=0.5,
# which will make the final layer learn less fast compared with other layers.
