# this is a config for 'fast' (7.5ms frame shift) high-resolution MFCC features,
# intended for use with chain models.  Note: we keep all cepstra, so it has the
# same info as filterbank features, but MFCC is more easily compressible
# (because less correlated) which is why we prefer this method.
--use-energy=false   # use average of log energy, not energy.
--sample-frequency=8000 #  Switchboard is sampled at 8kHz
--num-mel-bins=40     # similar to Google's setup.
--num-ceps=40     # there is no dimensionality reduction.
--low-freq=40    # low cutoff frequency for mel bins
--high-freq=-200 # high cutoff frequently, relative to Nyquist of 4000 (=3800)
--frame-length=25 # the normal frame length
--frame-shift=7.5
