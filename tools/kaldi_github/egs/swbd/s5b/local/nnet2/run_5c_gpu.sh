# This is on the full training set (with duplicates removed).  This version of the recipe runs on GPUs.
# We assume you have 8 GPU cards.  You have to use --num-threads 1 so it will
# use the version of the code that can use GPUs (the -parallel training code
# cannot use GPUs unless we make further modifications as the CUDA model assumes
# a single thread per GPU context, and we're not currently set up to create multiple
# GPU contexts.  We assume the queue is set up as in JHU (or
# as in the "Kluster" project on Sourceforge) where "gpu" is a consumable
# resource that you can set to number of GPU cards a machine has.

This script is intended to be used with GPUs but you have not compiled Kaldi with CUDA 
If you want to use GPUs (and have them), go to src/, and configure and make on a machine
where "nvcc" is installed.
