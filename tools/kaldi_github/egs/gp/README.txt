About the GlobalPhone corpus:
    This is a corpus of read sentences from the newspapers in 19
    different languages recorded under varying degrees of "clean" 
    conditions. There is roughly 15-20 hours of training data for
    each language, as well as DEV and EVAL sets of roughly 2 hours 
    each.

Each subdirectory of this directory contains the
scripts for a sequence of experiments.  


Please see s5/ which is the currently recommended set of scripts.
(the scripts in s1/ are deprecated.)
