# This script is modified from ^/egs/sre08/v1/sid/train_ivector_extractor.sh.
# It trains an iVector extractor for use in DNN training.

# This script trains the i-vector extractor.  Note: there are 3 separate levels
# of parallelization: num_threads, num_processes, and num_jobs.  This may seem a
# bit excessive.  It has to do with minimizing memory usage and disk I/O,
# subject to various constraints.  The "num_threads" is how many threads a
# program uses; the "num_processes" is the number of separate processes a single
# job spawns, and then sums the accumulators in memory.  Our recommendation:
#  - Set num_threads to the minimum of (4, or how many virtual cores your machine has).
#    (because of needing to lock various global quantities, the program can't
#    use many more than 4 threads with good CPU utilization).
#  - Set num_processes to the number of virtual cores on each machine you have, divided by
#    num_threads.  E.g. 4, if you have 16 virtual cores.   If you're on a shared queue
#    that's busy with other people's jobs, it may be wise to set it to rather less
#    than this maximum though, or your jobs won't get scheduled.  And if memory is
#    tight you need to be careful; in our normal setup, each process uses about 5G.
#  - Set num_jobs to as many of the jobs (each using $num_threads * $num_processes CPUs)
#    your queue will let you run at one time, but don't go much more than 10 or 20, or
#    summing the accumulators will possibly get slow.  If you have a lot of data, you
#    may want more jobs, though.

# Begin configuration section.
nj=10   # this is the number of separate queue jobs we run, but each one
        # contains num_processes sub-jobs.. the real number of threads we

        # separate pieces of data is nj * num_processes.
