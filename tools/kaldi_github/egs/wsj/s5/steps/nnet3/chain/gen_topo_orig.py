# This file is as ./gen_topo.py used to be (before we extended the transition-model
# code to support having a different self-loop pdf-class).  It is included
# here for baseline and testing purposes.


# Generate a topology file.  This allows control of the number of states in the
# non-silence HMMs, and in the silence HMMs.  This is a modified version of
# 'utils/gen_topo.pl' that generates a different type of topology, one that we
# believe should be useful in the 'chain' model.  Note: right now it doesn't
# have any real options, and it treats silence and nonsilence the same.  The
# intention is that you write different versions of this script, or add options,
# if you experiment with it.

# The next two lines may look like a bug, but they are as intended.  State 0 has
# no self-loop, it happens exactly once.  And it can go either to state 1 (with
# a self-loop) or to state 2, so we can have zero or more instances of state 1
# following state 0.
# We make the transition-probs 0.5 so they normalize, to keep the code happy.
# In fact, we always set the transition probability scale to 0.0 in the 'chain'
# code, so they are never used.
