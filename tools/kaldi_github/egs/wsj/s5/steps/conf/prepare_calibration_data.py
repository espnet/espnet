Prepare input features and training targets for logistic regression,
which calibrates the Minimum Bayes Risk posterior confidences.

The logisitc-regression input features are: 
- posteriors from 'ctm' transformed by logit,
- logarithm of word-length in letters,
- 10base logarithm of unigram probability of a word from language model,
- logarithm of average lattice-depth at position of the word (optional),

The logistic-regresion targets are:
- 1 for correct word,
- 0 for incorrect word (substitution, insertion),

The iput 'ctm' is augmented by per-word tags (or 'U' is added if no tags),
'C' = correct
'S' = substitution
'I' = insertion
'U' = unknown (not part of scored segment)

The script can be used both to prepare the training data,
or to prepare input features for forwarding through trained model.
