    ## A note on data-structure.
    ## Firstly, all words are represented as integers.
    ## We store n-gram counts as an array, indexed by (history-length == n-gram order minus one)
    ## (note: python calls arrays "lists")  of dicts from histories to counts, where
    ## histories are arrays of integers and "counts" are dicts from integer to float.
    ## For instance, when accumulating the 4-gram count for the '8' in the sequence '5 6 7 8',
    ## we'd do as follows:
    ##  self.counts[3][[5,6,7]][8] += 1.0
    ## where the [3] indexes an array, the [[5,6,7]] indexes a dict, and
    ## the [8] indexes a dict.
