# This script reads and writes the 'ctm-edits' file that is
# produced by get_ctm_edits.py.
#
# It is to be applied after modify_ctm_edits.py.  Its function is to add, in
# certain circumstances, an optional extra field with the word 'tainted' to the
# ctm-edits format, e.g an input line like:
#
# AJJacobs_2007P-0001605-0003029 1 0 0.09 <eps> 1.0 <eps> sil
# might become:
# AJJacobs_2007P-0001605-0003029 1 0 0.09 <eps> 1.0 <eps> sil tainted
#
# It also deletes certain lines, representing deletions, from the ctm (if they
# were next to taintable lines... their presence could then be inferred from the
# 'tainted' flag).
#
# You should interpret the 'tainted' flag as "we're not sure what's going on here;
# don't trust this."
#
# One of the problem this script is trying to solve is that if we have errors
# that are adjacent to silence or non-scored words
# it's not at all clear whether the silence or non-scored words were really such,
# or might have contained actual words.
# Also, if we have words in the reference that were realized as '<unk>' in the
# hypothesis, and they are adjacent to errors, it's almost always the case
# that the '<unk>' doesn't really correspond to the word in the reference, so
# we mark these as 'tainted'.
#
# The rule for tainting is quite simple; see the code.
