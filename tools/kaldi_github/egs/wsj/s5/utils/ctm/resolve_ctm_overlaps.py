"""
Script to combine ctms with overlapping segments.
The current approach is very simple. It ignores the words,
which are hypothesized in the half of the overlapped region
that is closer to the utterance boundary.
So if there are two segments
in the region 0s to 30s and 25s to 55s, with overlap of 5s,
the last 2.5s of the first utterance i.e. from 27.5s to 30s is truncated
and the first 2.5s of the second utterance i.e. from 25s to 27.s is truncated.
