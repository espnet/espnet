# This script creates a "lang" directory of the "testing" type (including G.fst)
# given an existing "alignment" directory and an existing "lang" directory.
# The directory contains only single-phone words, and a bigram language model that
# is built without smoothing, on top of single phones.  The point of no smoothing
# is to limit the number of transitions, so we can decode reasonably fast, and the
# graph won't blow up.  This is probably going to be most useful for things like
# language-id.
