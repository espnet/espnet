parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="""
This script, called from data/utils/combine_short_segments.sh, chooses consecutive
utterances to concatenate that will satisfy the minimum segment length.  It uses the
--spk2utt file to ensure that utterances from the same speaker are preferentially
combined (as far as possible while respecting the minimum segment length).
If it has to combine utterances across different speakers in order to satisfy the
duration constraint, it will assign the combined utterances to the speaker which
contributed the most to the duration of the combined utterances.


The utt2uts output of this program is a map from new
utterance-id to a list of old utterance-ids, so for example if the inputs were
utt1, utt2 and utt3, and utterances 2 and 3 were combined, the output might look
like:
utt1 utt1
utt2-combine2 utt2 utt3
The utt2spk output of this program assigns utterances to the speakers of the input;
in the (hopefully rare) case where utterances were combined across speakers, it
will assign the utterance to whichever of the original speakers contributed the most
to the grouped utterance.
