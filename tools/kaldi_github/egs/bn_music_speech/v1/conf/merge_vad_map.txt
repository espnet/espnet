# This table defines the mapping used by the binary merge-vads to 
# combine the output of compute-vad and compute-vad-from-frame-likes.
# The first column corresponds to VAD decisions from compute-vad
# and the second corresponds to VAD decisions from
# compute-vad-from-frame-likes.  The labels "0" and "1" in the
# first column represent (approximately) silence and nonsilence
# respectively.  The labels "0," "1," and "2" in the second column
# represent noise, speech, and music, respectively.  The third
# column lists the resulting output labels: "0," "1," and "2" 
# corresponding to silence/noise, speech, and music.
