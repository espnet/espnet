# This script prints out lines of the form:
# <score> <target-type>.
# Its output is meant to be used as input to the binary
# compute-eer. The Broadcast News utterances have either
# "music" or "speech" in the utterance name, and so we
# can simply check if the utterance name contains  one of
# those strings to determine if it is a target or nontarget
# utterance. We arbitrarily pick music to be the target class.
