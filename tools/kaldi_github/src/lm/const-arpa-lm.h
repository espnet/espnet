/**
    The following explains how the const arpa LM works. We will start from a toy
    example, and gradually get to the existing framework. Related classes are:
    LmState, ConstArpaLmBuilder and ConstArpaLm.

    First, let's explain how we can compute LM scores from an Arpa file. Suppose
    we want to get the N-gram prob for "A B C". We can code the lookup something
    very roughly like this:

    float GetNgramLogprob(hist, word) {  // hist = "A B", word = "C"
      backoff_logprob = 0.0;
      if ((state = GetLmState(hist)) != NULL) {
        // "A B" exists as a prefix in the LM
        if (state->HasWord(word)) {
          return state->Logprob(word);
        } else {
          // We'll need to backoff to "B C", but include the backoff penalty.
          backoff_logprob = state->BackoffLogprob();
        }
      }
      return backoff_logprob + GetNgramLogprob(hist_minus_first_word, word);
    }

    In terms of data-structures, in the most abstract form of it would be
    something like the following (note, we assume words in the lexicon can be
    represented as int32, and that these indexes are nonnegative):

    class LmState {  // e.g., LmState for "A B"
      // This is the actual LM-prob of this sequence, e.g. if this state is
      // "A B" then it would be the logprob of "A -> B".
      float logprob_;

      // Backoff probability for LM-state "A B" -> "X" backing off to "B" -> "X"
      // if "A B X" is not present in the language model.
      float backoff_logprob_;

      // e.g. "C" -> LmState of "A B C".
      std::unordered_map<int32, LmState*> children_;
    };

    The above design is very memory inefficient for two reasons:
    1. Suppose "A B" has no children, i.e. no C such that "A B C" is an n-gram.
       In this case the backoff_logprob will be zero and the 'children' vector
       will be empty. So all we need is the "float logprob_". Let's call "A B" a
       leaf in this case.
    2. The map std::unordered_map uses a lot of memory.

    A first iteration of making this efficient is to get rid of the map as
    follows:

    class LmState {
      float logprob_;
      float backoff_logprob_;
      std::vector<std::pair<int32, int32> > children_;
    };

    Here, the 'children_' vector contains pairs (child_word, child_info), sorted
    by 'child_word' so we can use binary search to locate the entry. We have to
    do some fancy bit-work to avoid having to allocate an LmState if a given
    N-gram is a leaf. We design the child_info in the children_ vector as
    follows:
    1. If it's an even number, then it represents a float (i.e. we
       reinterpret_cast to float), and the associated N-gram is a leaf. This
       requires losing the least significant bit of information in the float.
    2. If it's an odd number, then it will be used to represent a pointer to the
       LmState of the child. In order to use a 32-bit number to represent a
       possibly 64-bit pointer, we store the LmState structures in memory in
       a way that's sorted lexicographically by the vector of words, so that
       following "A B" will be the LmStates for "A B A", "A B B", "A B C" and so
       on (note, we actually deal with integers instead of letters). So if we
       make the pointers relative to the current LmState, most of them will be
       quite small (and all will be positive, due to the lexicographic sorting).
       As for the pointers that are too large, if any, we can have an "overflow
       buffer" indexed by a 30-bit index that stores, directly as pointers, the
       child LmStates. We use the first bit to distinguish the relative pointer
       case and the overflow pointer case, i.e.,
       a. If (child_info / 2) is positive, then (current_lmstate_pointer +
          child_info / 2) is the address of the child LmState.
       b. If (child_info / 2) is negative, then -1 * (child_info / 2) is the
          index into the overflow buffer which gives the address of the child
          LmState.

    Note that unigram LM-states are usually frequently accessed, so it makes
    sense to assign one LmState to each single word even if it would otherwise
    be "leaf" as defined above. We then can have an array of those unigram
    LM-states for efficient lookup.

    Also, we define the class LmState just to set up data structure for Arpa
    LM. In the end, we have a class like the following:

    class ConstArpaLm {
     public:
      // Some public functions.
     private:
      // Index of largest word-id, plus one; defines end of "unigram_states_"
      // array.
      int32 num_words_;

      // Loopup table for pointers of unigrams. The pointer could be NULL, for
      // example for those words that are in words.txt, but not in the language
      // model.
      int32 **unigram_states_;

      // Number of entries in the overflow buffer for pointers that couldn't be
      // represented as a 30-bit relative index
      int32 overflow_buffer_size_;

      // Technically a 32-bit number cannot represent a possibly 64-bit pointer.
      // We therefore use "relative" address instead of "absolute" address,
      // which will be a small number most of the time. This buffer is for the
      // case where the relative address has more than 30-bits.
      int32 **overflow_buffer_;

      // Size of the array lm_states_. This is required only for I/O.
      int64 lm_states_size_;

      // Data block for LmState.
      int32 *lm_states_;
    };

    Note, when we do I/O, we don't write out the arrays of pointers
    "overflow_buffer_" and "unigram_states_" directly. Instead we subtract
    "lm_states_" from each one before writing them out, so we are writing out
    indexes. Then, when we read them back in, after we allocate "lm_states_"
    we can convert them back to pointers. When we create these temporary arrays
    of indexes while reading and writing, we use int64, even if the pointer type
    of the machine is int32. This way the I/O is independent of the pointer size
    of the machine.

    Now it is time to put things together.

    ConstArpaLmBuilder takes charge of reading in the Arpa LM and building the
    ConstArpaLm.

    ConstArpaLM holds the Arpa LM in memory, and provides interfaces for LM
    operations, such as GetNgramLogprob().

    LmState is an auxiliary class that computes the relative pointers for
    ConstArpaLmBuilder and ConstArpaLm. It will only be called once during the
    building process, so it doesn't have to be very efficient.

    In summary, the general building process is as follows:
    1. In ConstArpaLmBuilder, read in the Arpa format LM. While reading, we keep
       in memory something like this:
         std::unordered_map<std::vector<int32>,
                            LmState*, VectorHasher<int32> > seq_to_state_;
       The map helps us to convert n-gram entries into LmState (including
       setting up the parent-children relationship, see above about LmState).
       Note that at this stage, we don't work on the relative pointers yet.
    2. In ConstArpaLmBuilder, create a sorted vector from <seq_to_state_>
         std::vector<std::pair<std::vector<int32>*, LmState*> > sorted_vec;
       Note, only LmState with non-zero MemSize() should be put into the sorted
       vector, and we sort it lexicographically according to the word.
    3. In ConstArpaLmBuilder, update the address for each LmState, relative to
       the first LmState in the sorted vector (i.e. assume the first LmState has
       address 0, and work out the rest LmState address using the MemSize() of
       each LmState).
    4. In ConstArpaLmBuilder, create a memory block for all the LmStates (after
       sorting and updating the address). This includes <lm_state_> that stores
       all the LmStates in an int32 array, <unigram_states_> that keeps the
       address of unigram LmStates, <overflow_buffer_> that keeps the address
       of LmState whose address differs too much from the parent address. See
       above how we handle the leaf case.
    5. With the information in step 4, create the class ConstArpaLm.
