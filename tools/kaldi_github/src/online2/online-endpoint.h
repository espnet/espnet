/**
   This header contains a simple facility for endpointing, that should be used
   in conjunction with the "online2" online decoding code; see
   ../online2bin/online2-wav-gmm-latgen-faster-endpoint.cc.  By endpointing in
   this context we mean "deciding when to stop decoding", and not generic
   speech/silence segmentation.  The use-case that we have in mind is some kind
   of dialog system where, as more speech data comes in, we decode more and
   more, and we have to decide when to stop decoding.

   The endpointing rule is a disjunction of conjunctions.  The way we have
   it configured, it's an OR of five rules, and each rule has the following form:

      (<contains-nonsilence> || !rule.must_contain_nonsilence) &&
       <length-of-trailing-silence> >= rule.min_trailing_silence &&
       <relative-cost> <= rule.max_relative_cost &&
       <utterance-length> >= rule.min_utterance_length)

   where:
    <contains-nonsilence> is true if the best traceback contains any nonsilence phone;
    <length-of-trailing-silence> is the length in seconds of silence phones at the
      end of the best traceback (we stop counting when we hit non-silence),
    <relative-cost> is a value >= 0 extracted from the decoder, that is zero if
      a final-state of the grammar FST had the best cost at the final frame, and
      infinity if no final-state was active (and >0 for in-between cases).
    <utterance-length> is the number of seconds of the utterance that we have
      decoded so far.

   All of these pieces of information are obtained from the best-path
   traceback from the decoder, which is output by the function GetBestPath().
   We do this every time we're finished processing a chunk of data.
   [ Note: we're changing the decoders so that GetBestPath() is efficient
   and does not require operations on the entire lattice. ]

   For details of the default rules, see struct OnlineEndpointConfig.

   It's up to the caller whether to use final-probs or not when generating the
   best-path, i.e. whether to call decoder.GetBestPath(&lat, (true or false)),
   but my recommendation is not to use them.  If you do use them, then depending
   on the grammar, you may force the best-path to decode non-silence even though
   that was not what it really preferred to decode.
