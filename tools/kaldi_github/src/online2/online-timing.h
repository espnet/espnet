/// class OnlineTimer is used to test real-time decoding algorithms and evaluate
/// how long the decoding of a particular utterance would take.  The 'obvious'
/// way to evaluate this would be to measure the wall-clock time, and if we're
/// processing the data in chunks, to sleep() until a given chunk would become
/// available in a real-time application-- e.g. say we need to process a chunk
/// that ends half a second into the utterance, we would sleep until half a
/// second had elapsed since the start of the utterance.  In this code we
/// have the option to not actually sleep: we can simulate the effect of
/// sleeping by just incrementing
/// a variable that says how long we would have slept; and we add this to
/// wall-clock times obtained from Timer::Elapsed().
/// The usage of this class will be something like as follows:
/// \code
/// OnlineTimingStats stats;
/// while (.. process different utterances..) {
///   OnlineTimer this_utt_timer(utterance_id);
///   while (...process chunks of this utterance..) {
///      double num_secs_elapsed = 0.01 * num_frames;
///      this_utt_timer.WaitUntil(num_secs_elapsed);
///   }
///   this_utt_timer.OutputStats(&stats);
/// \endcode
/// This assumes that the value provided to the last WaitUntil()
/// call was the length of the utterance.
