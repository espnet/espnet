/**
   class ThreadSynchronizer acts to guard an arbitrary type of buffer between a
   producing and a consuming thread (note: it's all symmetric between the two
   thread types).  It has a similar interface to a mutex, except that instead of
   just Lock and Unlock, it has Lock, UnlockSuccess and UnlockFailure, and each
   function takes an argument kProducer or kConsumer to identify whether the
   producing or consuming thread is waiting.

   The basic concept is that you lock the object; and if you discover the you're
   blocked because you're either trying to read an empty buffer or trying to
   write to a full buffer, you unlock with UnlockFailure; and this will cause
   your next call to Lock to block until the *other* thread has called Lock and
   then UnlockSuccess.  However, if at that point the other thread calls Lock
   and then UnlockFailure, it is an error because you can't have both producing
   and consuming threads claiming that the buffer is full/empty.  If you lock
   the object and were successful you call UnlockSuccess; and you call
   UnlockSuccess even if, for your own reasons, you ended up not changing the
   state of the buffer.
