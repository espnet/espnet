= Kaldi Gstreamer plugin =

Plugin for GStreamer 1.0 framework, using the OnlineGmmDecodeFaster 
decoder. Accepts 16000 kHz 16 bit audio and decodes it on the fly,
decoder words are "pushed" out using a callback.


== Requirements ==

Following packages are needed for the GStreamer plugin:

  * libgstreamer1.0-dev
  * gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
  * gstreamer1.0-tools
  * gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio (only required for the demos in egs/voxforge/gst_demo)
  
On Debian Wheezy, the GStreamer 1.0 packages are available from the backports repository (http://backports.debian.org/).

On Ubuntu, you might need to use this PPA: https://launchpad.net/~gstreamer-developers/+archive/ppa
 
== Install ==

Compile rest of the Kaldi using the 'shared' flavour. To do this,
invoke 'configure' with the `--shared` switch.

Also, make the online extensions  (make ext)

Now, run:

make depend
make

This should result in libgstonlinegmmdecodefaster.so which contains the GStreamer plugin

== Usage ==

See egs/voxforge/gst_demo
