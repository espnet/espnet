# the official kaldi repo is a remote named 'upstream', as shown
# here:
# git remote -vv | grep upstream
# upstream	git@github.com:kaldi-asr/kaldi.git (fetch)
# upstream	git@github.com:kaldi-asr/kaldi.git (push)
# Since Dan is going to be the one running this script and that's
# how he does it, this should work fine.

# VERSION
# When you increment the version of Kaldi you'll want to
# add a new tuple to the 'for' statement, of the form "5.x master yyyy".
# where the tuples will generally be of the form: "x.x master yyyyyy"
# where yyyyy is the result of git log -1 src/.version on
# that version of Kaldi (we only update the .version file when
# the major/minor version number changes).
# You should change the previous 'master' to the previous version number,
# e.g. 5.2 (this assumes you created a branch in Kaldi's repository that
# archives that version of Kaldi).
# Note: when you add new tuples here you'll also want to add ndew
# \htmlinclude directives in versions.dox.
