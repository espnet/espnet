  This tutorial assumes that you know the basics of speech recognition using the
  HMM-GMM approach.  One brief introduction that is available online
  is: M. Gales and S. Young (2007). ``The Application of Hidden Markov
  Models in Speech Recognition." Foundations and Trends in Signal Processing
  1(3): 195-304.  The HTK Book is also a good resource.  However, unless you
  have a strong mathematical background and are extremely dedicated, we
  discourage trying to learn about speech recognition outside an institutional
  setting.  The intended audience for this tutorial is either speech recognition
  researchers, or graduates or advanced undergraduates who are studying this
  area anyway.

  We assume that you know C++, and have at least some familiarity with shell
  scripting, preferably using bash or a similar shell.  This tutorial assumes you
  are using a UNIX-like environment or Cygwin (although Kaldi will not
  necessarily compile and run in all such environments).

  Also, importantly, the tutorial assumes you have access to the data on the Resource
  Management (RM) CDs from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), in the original form
  as distributed by the LDC.  That is, we assume this data is sitting on your system
  somewhere.  We obtained this as catalog number LDC93S3A.   It is
  also available in two separate pieces.  Be careful because there was previously
  a different distribution of the RM data with a different layout.

  The system requirements are fairly basic.  We assume that you have tools
  including wget, git, svn, awk, perl and so on, or that you know how to install them.
  The most difficult part of the installation process relates to the math library
  ATLAS; if this is not already installed as a library on your system you will
  have to compile it, and this requires that CPU throttling be turned off, which
  may require root priveleges.  We provide scripts and detailed instructions for
  all installation steps.  When scripts fail, read the output carefully because
  it tries to provide guidance as to how to fix problems.  Please inform us if there
  are problems at any point, however minor; see \ref other.

  We try to provide some idea how long it should take to execute each step of the tutorial.
  If there is a limited amount of time available to complete the tutorial, we recommend
  to try to keep to the posted schedule, if necessary by skipping steps and avoiding
  following links to more information that we provide in the text.  This will help ensure
  that you get a balanced overview.  You can always review the material in more
  detail later on.  If this tutorial is to be given in a classroom setting, it is
  important that someone run through the tutorial on the relevant system beforehand in order
  to verify that all the prerequisites are installed.
