/**
   PrunedCompactLatticeComposer implements an algorithm for pruned composition.
   It uses a heuristic (like the heuristics used in A*) to estimate the
   cost to the end of a graph, of the best path that we might get if
   we expand a particular transition out of a particular state.  This enables
   us to use a priority queue to expand arcs in the composed result in an
   order roughly from most promising to least promising.

   Because some of the quantities used in the heuristic are hard to efficiently
   keep updated as the composed output is incrementally added to, we
   periodically recompute these quantities (c.f. RecomputePruningInfo()).
   In order to prevent this periodic recomputation from dominating the time
   taken to produce the lattice, we recompute these things on a schedule where,
   between each computation, we allow the size of the output to grow by
   a constant factor (default: 1.5).  Since the time taken to do the
   recomputation of quantities used in the heuristic takes time linear in the
   size of the so-far existing composed output, doing so on this type of schedule
   will add no more than a constant factor to the runtime.

    //  - On the other hand, if backward_cost is infinite: delta_backward_cost
    //     is set to the delta_backward_cost of the previous state on the best

    //    delta_backward_cost will be inherited from the source state from
    //    which the new state was expanded.
    //  - For other states, delta_backward_cost will be unchanged since

    //                  delta_backward_cost + arc_delta_cost.
    // expected_cost_offset will always equal the above minus lat_best_cost_.
