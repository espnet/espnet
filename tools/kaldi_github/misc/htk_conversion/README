This is an example of a HTK conversion script that converts HTK models
to Kaldi format models.  It's not being actively maintained.  This
script is not very general-- since HTK's MMF format can contain almost
anything, it's hard to create a general solution.

# HTK conversion script:

# This example for the conversion was kindly provided Yanqing Sun.  However, we
# are not sure that it has been correctly converted.  We are providing it as an
# example anyway-- perhaps someone can debug it.  It has been our experience
# when converting HTK models that whenever we get the conversion script working,
# some other HTK model comes along and breaks the script.  In general this
# conversion is something that we don't aim to put a lot of effort into
# supporting-- our attitude is, if you like HTK, then use HTK.
