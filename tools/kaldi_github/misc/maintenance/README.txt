# This directory contains various scripts that can be used to maintain certain
# aspects of the Kaldi code: various things that are supposed to be run
# automatically.

# There are some things that are not included here that relate to maintenance and
# checking:

# ../src/doc/README,
# which Dan generally runs by doing:
# cd ../src
# . doc/README
# (but this won't work for most people, as relies on certain things being set up right
# on Sourceforge).

# also ../src/doc/cpplint.py is useful as a style checker.
