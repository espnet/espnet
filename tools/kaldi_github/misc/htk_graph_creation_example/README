This script is not being maintained and is not guaranteed to work.
Its inputs are specific to the BUT system.



This directory contains some scripts that convert HTK models into Kaldi format
and build decoding graphs.  They take as input a CallHome English setup that's
already on the BUT system.  There are a couple of different recipes: a "basic"
one, and a "factored" one that removes the unusual transitions from the
transition-model for silence, which enables it to use a more efficient
implementation.  It produces the output in two parts which would have to be composed
to decode (possibly in the decoder, but this isn't implemented yet).

To run this, do: 
run_basic.sh  
test_basic.sh

run_factored.sh    
test_factored.sh
