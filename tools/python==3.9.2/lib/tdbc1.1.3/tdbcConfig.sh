# This shell script (for sh) is generated automatically by TDBC's configure
# script. It will create shell variables for most of the configuration options
# discovered by the configure script. This script is intended to be included
# by the configure scripts for TDBC extensions so that they don't have to
# figure this all out for themselves.
